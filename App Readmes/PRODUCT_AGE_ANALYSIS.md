# Product Age Analysis Feature

This feature automatically analyzes the age of products referenced in homepage modules and provides insights about which products may need updating.

## How It Works

### 1. Sanity Function (`functions/product-map/index.ts`)

The function is triggered whenever a homepage document is updated. It:

- Extracts all product references from grid modules in the homepage
- Fetches the creation and update dates for each product
- Calculates the age in days since the last update
- Determines if products are "old" (older than 30 days)
- Stores this analysis in the homepage document's `productAgeAnalysis` field

### 2. Homepage Schema Enhancement

Added a new `productAgeAnalysis` field to the homepage schema that includes:

- **Product Reference**: Link to the product
- **Last Updated**: When the product was last modified
- **Created At**: When the product was created
- **Age in Days**: Days since last update
- **Is Old**: Boolean flag for products older than 30 days

The field includes a rich preview showing product titles, age, and status indicators.

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### GROQ Queries
- `PRODUCT_AGE_ANALYSIS_QUERY`: Fetches product age data with product details
- Updated `HOME_PAGE_QUERY` to include the product age analysis

#### React Components
- `ProductAgeAnalysis`: A debug-mode component that displays:
  - Summary statistics (total products, old products, average age)
  - Detailed list of all products with their ages
  - Visual indicators (ðŸ”´ for old, ðŸŸ¢ for fresh products)
  - Actionable warnings when old products are detected

## Usage

### For Developers

1. **Enable Debug Mode**: Use the debug toggle to see the product age analysis
2. **View Analysis**: The component appears in the bottom-right corner when debug mode is active
3. **Monitor Product Health**: Get immediate feedback about content freshness

### For Content Managers

1. **Automatic Updates**: The analysis updates whenever the homepage is saved
2. **Visual Indicators**: Clear color coding shows product status at a glance
3. **Actionable Insights**: Specific warnings about products needing attention

## Configuration

### Age Threshold
Currently set to 30 days in the function. To change this:

```typescript
const isOld = ageInDays > 30; // Change 30 to desired threshold
```

### Trigger Events
The function runs on:
- Homepage document creation
- Homepage document updates
- Module changes within the homepage

## Benefits

1. **Content Freshness**: Easily identify stale product content
2. **Maintenance Alerts**: Proactive notifications about outdated products
3. **Performance Insights**: Understand content update patterns
4. **Quality Control**: Ensure homepage showcases current products

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Homepage updated â†’ Sanity function triggered
2. Function analyzes product references â†’ Calculates ages
3. Analysis stored in homepage document â†’ Frontend queries data
4. Debug component displays insights â†’ Content team takes action

### Performance
- Analysis runs asynchronously after document updates
- Cached in the homepage document for fast frontend access
- Minimal impact on page load times

## Future Enhancements

- Configurable age thresholds per product type
- Email notifications for critical age thresholds
- Batch analysis across multiple pages
- Integration with content workflows
- Historical trending of product ages
